### General Chairs

**[Adam Perer](http://perer.org/)**  
 
Adam Perer is an Assistant Research Professor at Carnegie Mellon University, where he is a member of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. His research integrates data visualization and machine learning techniques to create visual interactive systems to help users make sense out of big data. Lately, his research focuses on human-centered data science and extracting insights from clinical data to support data-driven medicine. This work has been published at premier venues in visualization, human-computer interaction, and medical informatics. He was previously a Research Scientist at IBM Research. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park.

**[Hendrik Strobelt](http://hendrik.strobelt.com/)** 

Hendrik Strobelt is a Researcher in Information Visualisation, Visual Analytics, and Machine Learning at IBM Research AI in Cambridge, MA. He is interested in Visualization of large data sets of unstructured/semi-structured data, biological data, and neural network models.

### Paper Chairs

**[Liang Gou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x3VK0fAAAAAJ&hl=en)**  

Liang Gou is a Principal Research Scientist at Bosch Research. His research interests lie in the fields of visual analytics, deep learning and human-computer interaction. Prior to joining Bosch Research, Liang was a Principal Research Scientist at Visa Research and a Research Staff Member at IBM Almaden Research Center.

**[Alvitta Ottley](http://visualdata.wustl.edu)**

Alvitta Ottley is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. She also holds a courtesy appointment in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. Her research uses interdisciplinary approaches to solve problems such as how best to display information for effective decision-making and how we can design human-in-the-loop visual analytics interfaces that are more attuned to the way people think.
