### General Chairs

**[Shixia Liu](http://shixialiu.com/)**
    
Shixia Liu is an associate professor at Tsinghua University. Her research interests include visual text analytics, visual model analytics, visual behavior analytics, and text mining. Shixia is an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics and was the papers co-chair of IEEE VAST 2016 and 2017.

**[Adam Perer](http://perer.org/)**  
 
Adam Perer is an Assistant Research Professor at Carnegie Mellon University, where he is a member of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. His research integrates data visualization and machine learning techniques to create visual interactive systems to help users make sense out of big data. Lately, his research focuses on human-centered data science and extracting insights from clinical data to support data-driven medicine. This work has been published at premier venues in visualization, human-computer interaction, and medical informatics. He was previously a Research Scientist at IBM Research. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park.
