bio: |
    Jenny Bryan (twitter, GitHub) is a Software Engineer at RStudio, working on the team lead by Hadley Wickham. This team brings you the popular set of packages known as the Tidyverse, as well as a set of low-level infrastructure packages. She is on leave from being an Associate Professor of Statistics at the University of British Columbia. Jenny has an undergraduate degree in Economics and German Literature from Yale University and earned her PhD in Biostatistics at UC Berkeley. 

    Jenny has been using and teaching R (or S!) for 20 years, most recently in STAT 545 and Software Carpentry. Other aspects of her R life include ordinary membership in the R Foundation, work with rOpenSci, development/maintenance of R packages (such as readxl), and leading the curriculum development for UBC's Master of Data Science. 

abstract: |
    If you are struggling to make a plot, tear yourself away from stackoverflow for a moment and ... take a hard look at your data. Is it really in the most favorable form for the task at hand? I must confess that I am no visualization pro. But even as a data analyst, I've made a very great number of plots. Time and time again I have found that my visualization struggles are really a symptom of unfinished data wrangling. I will give an overview of the data wrangling landscape, with a special emphasis on R (my language of choice), but including high-level principles that are applicable to those working in other languages.
